(***) - Highest priority

(*) - Lowest priority

## Branding
Before I can start on this, I need to to know
- *** Name of the product (Kite-lite? Kite-Lite? Kite Lite?)
> Kite Lite is the company name.  The product we have photos of is the Fin Lite.  

- *** One or two colors that will be used consistently with your product
> Blue:  0067d0.  Also, some form of really light grey (background) to go well with night and daytime photos.  Derivatives of that light grey.  Beyond that, we're still playing with too many options and are open to anything. 

## Content

I know nothing about this product, which means that you'll have to supply me with not only content (pictures, writing, etc), but also the structure of this content.
Please think about:
- (***) How many different content sections you would like (i.e. "How It Works", "What Is It?", "About Us", etc)
> one.  Just a page with pictures, contact info, and our current working motto; see below. 

- (**) How much content you would like in which sections (i.e. a few paragraphs, a couple sentences, some bullet points, etc)
> There is only one section (page) we're imagining.  The layout is at your discretion.  Company name: Kite Lite // Motto: Kiting at night with style.  //  Follow us on Facebook for the latest. 

  >> I'm just the developer here, but I think we need more content than just this. What is it? How/when/where can I get one? Take a look at the live site. Everything that has been requested as content has been allocated space there, but we are still missing quite a bit of information, me thinks.
  
  >>> Truth is, we're not even sure we're making this a company yet.  This is our "test the waters" phase.  We plan to add pics for the Wing Lite also in the near-term, but we don't really want to promise things we can't even schedule yet.  We'll get there, but for now we are experimenting with revealing little but hinting at much.  

- (*) What the written content will actually be.
> What you see in the previous and next answers.

- (***) The contact information that you want to display
> info@kite-lite.com (we need to set this up), a link to a facebook page. 

  >> Let me know when both of these have been set up. Have you set up custom domain emails before?
  
  >>> Maybe.  I did arrange for my last company to have a custom domain email, but that was packaged conveniently with Go-daddy hosting services, so I really didn't have to do much tinkering. 

- (***) High quality picture(s)  
> This is what we have for now - https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zx3f9sujo87fapa/AACu6KkPfn8rHCf24-qK64VXa?dl=0

## Other thoughts
- (***) Having a hit counter is __very__ 90's. I don't think we should have this on the site.
  - Edit: Maybe you meant an analytics tracker? Either way, analytics are very easy to set up and also very valuable, so I'm definitely doing it.

  > yes, we meant an analytics tracker, not a forward-facing hit-counter.  Agreed about that being 90's. 

  >> This will be set up once the domain and site are hooked up.

- (***) What does your timeframe look like? There's not much for me to do at this point until the parts I've mentioned above are done.
  > We're hoping to make a little splash in the community here and measure it in about 2 weeks.  Between now and then, we have to upload pictures of our forthcoming Wing Lite (the next product).  

## Host choice, Payment, Making Future Changes
- (***) Do you think our budget of $500 will get us to where we want to be?  And how would you like to be paid?

  >> Yeah, that will be more than enough if we introduce some constraints. For example, Github offers free hosting, so unless you two want to have a CMS so that you two can create and design all of your content through an editor, we can just keep everything on Github. Taking the GH route, copy changes would require one of you to:
  1) Edit the HTML yourself and hope it looks good on the site since you would not be able to preview.
  2) Ask me to edit the copy.
  3) I can guide you through installation this repository on your Windows as best as I can, which would allow you to view the changes before making them appear on the site.
  
    >>> Let's go for Github hosting and option 3 when you feel it will be easiest.  We don't want to put strings on you.  Cristina once gave me a lesson in emulating linux on windows to enable previewing of a website.  If that's the plan here, I'd prefer to just dedicate an old laptop to running linux.  Just give me the go and a list of necessary software and I'll do the installs for homework. 

  >> Pay me for... my services?
  
  >>> Yes, for your services, and your cranberry muffins.  The $500 would be all for you.  The hosting is a separate item in our books. 

- (***) I have bought the domain (kite-lite.com) through hostgator, but have not yet bought hosting services.  Should we use hostgator for hosting, or would you like to use someone else?  If someone else is your preference, perhaps I should buy those services and provide you access to the controls so I can manage the billing going forward?  Let me know what you think is best here, and I'll get right on it.

  >> I guess I already answered this. I think GH hosting is a great solution for sites that are light on content. Cristina and I have hosted tons of stuff for free through GH, including walterroman.com and http://whroman.github.io/minesweeper-react.
  
    >>> You totally delayed our response by an hour with that minesweeper game.  Nicely done.
