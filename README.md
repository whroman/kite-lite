## Branding
Before I can start on this, I need to to know
- *** Name of the product (Kite-lite? Kite-Lite? Kite Lite?)
- A: Kite Lite is the company name.  The product we have photos of is the Fin Lite.  

- *** One or two colors that will be used consistently with your product
- A: Blue:  0067d0.  Also, some form of really light grey (background) to go well with night and daytime photos.  Derivatives of that light grey.  Beyond that, we're still playing with too many options and are open to anything. 

## Content

I know nothing about this product, which means that you'll have to supply me with not only content (pictures, writing, etc), but also the structure of this content.
Please think about:
- (***) How many different content sections you would like (i.e. "How It Works", "What Is It?", "About Us", etc)
- A: one.  Just a page with pictures, contact info, and our current working motto; see below. 

- (**) How much content you would like in which sections (i.e. a few paragraphs, a couple sentences, some bullet points, etc)
- A: There is only one section (page) we're imagining.  The layout is at your discretion.  Company name: Kite Lite // Motto: Kiting at night with style.  //  Follow us on Facebook for the latest. 

- (*) What the written content will actually be.
- A: What you see in the previous and next answers.

- (***) The contact information that you want to display
- A: info@kite-lite.com (we need to set this up), a link to a facebook page. 

- (***) High quality picture(s)  
- A: This is what we have for now - https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zx3f9sujo87fapa/AACu6KkPfn8rHCf24-qK64VXa?dl=0

## Other thoughts
- (***) Having a hit counter is __very__ 90's. I don't think we should have this on the site.
  - Edit: Maybe you meant an analytics tracker? Either way, analytics are very easy to set up and also very valuable, so I'm definitely doing it.
  - A: yes, we meant an analytics tracker, not a forward-facing hit-counter.  Agreed about that being 90's. 

- (***) What does your timeframe look like? There's not much for me to do at this point until the parts I've mentioned above are done.
- A: We're hoping to make a little splash in the community here and measure it in about 2 weeks.  Between now and then, we have to upload pictures of our forthcoming Wing Lite (the next product).  

## Questions from Mike & Kim
- (***) Do you think our budget of $500 will get us to where we want to be?  And how would you like to be paid?  
- (***) I have bought the domain (kite-lite.com) through hostgator, but have not yet bought hosting services.  Should we use hostgator for hosting, or would you like to use someone else?  If someone else is your preference, perhaps I should buy those services and provide you access to the controls so I can manage the billing going forward?  Let me know what you think is best here, and I'll get right on it.
