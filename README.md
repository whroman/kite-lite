(***) - Highest priority

(*) - Lowest priority

## Branding
Before I can start on this, I need to to know
- *** Name of the product (Kite-lite? Kite-Lite? Kite Lite?)
- *** One or two colors that will be used consistently with your product

## Content

I know nothing about this product, which means that you'll have to supply me with not only content (pictures, writing, etc), but also the structure of this content.
Please think about:
- (***) How many different content sections you would like (i.e. "How It Works", "What Is It?", "About Us", etc)
- (**) How much content you would like in which sections (i.e. a few paragraphs, a couple sentences, some bullet points, etc)
- (*) What the written content will actually be.
- (***) The contact information that you want to display
- (***) High quality picture(s)

## Other thoughts
- (***) Having a hit counter is __very__ 90's. I don't think we should have this on the site.
- (***) What does your timeframe look like? There's not much for me to do at this point until the parts I've mentioned above are done.
